# Wingo Data Scraper

This project is a Python script that uses **Selenium** to scrape betting data from the Wingo 1-minute game platform. The script logs in, navigates through the pages, scrapes betting results, and saves them into a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Firefox browser
- Geckodriver (for Selenium and Firefox)
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)
